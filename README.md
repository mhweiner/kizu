Kizu is a screamingly fast, minimalist test runner for TypeScript and JavaScript. It has a small, easy-to-learn API that lets you focus on your tests, not your tooling.

Designed to help you write simple, readable, and maintainable tests that do not slow you down.

## Features

### **ðŸš€ Fast & Reliable**
- Fast, multi-process parallel test runner. Each test file is run in its own process/runtime for performance and isolation benefits. _Use on a multicore machine for even better results!_
- Optimized for speed and simplicity.
- Minimal dependencies.

### **ðŸ˜€ Easy to Use**
- Very simple functional [assertion API](docs/api.md). No need to learn a DSL or framework.
- Powerful `assert.equal()` assertion method handles primitives, deep objects, arrays, Maps, Sets, and even RegExp pattern matching. Uses strict equality and comparison by value. Helps keep your tests simple and readable.
- Built-in [powerful diff visualization tool](/docs/visualDiff.md) to help you debug failed assertions.
- Clean, organized output.
- Failed tests are easy to find, grouped at the end of the output.
- Errors or unhandled promise rejections are buffered and grouped under the test file in the output. This helps you know where they came from.
- Clean stack traces with no extra noise.

### **ðŸ›¡ Defensive**
- Uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections will cause the test to fail.
- Any spec files without tests, or tests without assertions, result in a failed test.
- Strict and deep equality comparison by default.

### **ðŸ”’ Out-of-the-box Typescript support**
- No special configuration needed, and no plugins to install. 
- Automatically detects and uses your project's `tsconfig.json` and uses `tsx` for TypeScript compilation.
- Works great with [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) for code coverage out of the box (see [getting started](docs/gettingStarted.md)).
- Handles compilation errors gracefully.

## Quick Examples

For more examples, see the [examples](examples) and [src](src) folders.

```bash
# Run all tests in the src directory and its subdirectories, and only show failures in the output.
npx kizu 'src/**/*.test.ts' --fail-only

# Run a specific test file and show all output
npx kizu 'src/example.test.ts'
```

```typescript
// example.test.ts

import {test} from 'kizu';

// Basic test
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `hello, ${name}`;
}

test('greet', (assert) => {
  assert.equal(greet('world'), 'hello, world');
});

// Deep object comparison
test('user object', (assert) => {
  const actual = {
    name: 'John',
    age: 30,
    email: 'john@example.com',
    hobbies: ['reading', 'coding', 'hiking'],
    preferences: {
      theme: 'dark',
      notifications: true
    }
  };
  const expected = {
    name: /^[A-Za-z]+$/,
    age: /^\d+$/,
    email: /^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$/,
    hobbies: ['reading', 'coding', 'hiking'],
    preferences: {
      theme: 'dark',
      notifications: true
    }
  };
  
  assert.equal(actual, expected); // Complex & deep strict object comparison by value, type-safe, and with regular expressions!
});

// Error handling
function throwError(): never {
  throw new Error('oops');
}

test('throwError', (assert) => {
  assert.throws(() => throwError(), /oops/);
});

// Async test
async function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return Promise.resolve('data');
}

test('fetchData', async (assert) => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  assert.equal(data, 'data');
});
```
